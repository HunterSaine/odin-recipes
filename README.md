# odin-recipes

This projects purpose is to create a website that features several recipes. The goal is to build a functioning website with HTML, so I can practice what I have learned so far in The Odin Project. When I'm finished, I will have shown my ability to use HTML to create a working website. In particular, I will show that I can use links to navigate different pages.
