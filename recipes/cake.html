    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 sticks of unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 cups of flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups of sugar</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup of whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and
        line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the
        pans with flour, tapping out the excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined.
        Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on
        medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the
        mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down
        the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated
        at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with
        the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are
        lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out
        clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then
        run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the
        racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the
        cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>Add your preferred icing and enjoy!</li>
